# Ate too much!?
Is a game where you move left and right trying to catch the apples falling from sky (haven??). 3 misses and you are out! You can play the live game [here.](https://mihinmud.github.io/ateTooMuch/)
## More info
This project is just an attempt of making a game without using a dedicated game engine. Instead it uses a HTML5 rendering engine called [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com).
